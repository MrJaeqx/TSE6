OpenCL dingetjes  
  
CPUMandelbrot -> Mandelbrot fractal calculated on CPU and saved as bmp.  
GPUMandelbrot -> Mandelbrot fractal calculated on GPU and saved as bmp.  
GPUMandelbrotGL -> Mandelbrot fractal calculated on GPU and displayed in openGL window.  
  
CPUPythagoras -> Pythagoras fractal calculated on CPU and displayed in openGL window.  
GPUPythagoras -> Pythagoras fractal calculated on GPU and displayed in openGL window.  
  
OpenCL_1 -> First test in openCL, add vectors.  
OpenCL_2 -> Get openCL devices and print info.  
OpenCL_3 -> Three different methods to add values on GPU.  
  
  
To run:  
  -> First compile freeglut-2.8.1 (freeglut-2.8.1/VisualStudio/2012/freeglut.sln)  
  -> In each solution check PATH to openCL and freeglut dll's and libraries.
